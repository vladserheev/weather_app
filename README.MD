### Modern weather app
So you have a new nice task. You have to reinvent weather task.
We prepare some HTML for you. It with some mistakes, but don't worry, you still can fix them.

You need to use three data sources:
1. JSON file that lay down on your server
2. Your MySQL database
3. Third party API service

You can do anything you want with files that you receive. It's a template.
You have to make modern weather web application.

The main idea of this task is writing [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) code that will work fine in the different situations. Good luck. Let the force be with you.
